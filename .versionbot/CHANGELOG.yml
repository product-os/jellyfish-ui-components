        Firstly, some browsers have trouble scrolling smoothly - the scroll
        never completes. Secondly, when first loading the timeline, it's more
        useful to scroll immediately to the bottom. This has actually been
        requested by users.

        the correct combination of append, to and blank. Relative or local URLs
        are appended to the current path, while any other URLs will open in a
        new tab.
